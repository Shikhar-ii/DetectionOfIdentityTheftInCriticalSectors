## Overview

This research reviews and analyzes identity theft detection techniques used in critical sectors including:

- Finance  
- Government  
- Healthcare  

The study evaluates how different machine learning and deep learning approaches perform in detecting fraudulent and malicious identity-related activities across structured and relational datasets.

---

## Methodology

Multiple models were evaluated using standard performance metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Sensitivity (Recall)  
- F1-Score  
- False Positive Rate  

Comparative analysis was conducted across traditional machine learning and graph-based approaches.

## Evaluated Models

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  
- Deep Learning Models  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  

---

## Key Findings

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** perform best for accurate and real-time detection in relational data environments.  
- **SVM and Random Forest** models achieve high precision with fewer false positives.  
- Deep learning models capture complex patterns but require higher computational resources.  
- Most existing research focuses on large organizations, with limited protection strategies for individual users and small-scale identity theft attacks.

## Contribution

This paper:

- Identifies current research gaps in identity theft detection  
- Highlights the importance of relational and behavioral modeling  
- Recommends adaptive, sector-specific detection frameworks  
- Emphasizes protection mechanisms for everyday users, not only large enterprises  

---

## Takeaway

Effective identity theft detection requires context-aware models that analyze:

- Behavioral patterns over time  
- Relationships between entities  
- Cross-sector threat signals  

Graph Neural Networks show strong potential for next-generation identity theft detection systems.
